					SMEs act as an important part in the transition to low-carbon economy, but generally lack information on emission reduction, along with methods to achieve the reduction target, and many kinds of opportunities like technology and money saving within the process. Therefore, we introduce the educational tool to SMEs that sign the pledge to help them better act in the transition process, including offsetting, as an tool for SMEs that either face difficulties in the short-term or wish to achieve carbon neutral, and impact of changes and money saving. <br>
					SMEs operate and create opportunities across a wide array of sectors, employ different labour forces, provide skill development opportunities and contribute to green growth through eco-innovation, eco-adoption, and eco-entrepreneurship. However, SMEs, on aggregate, have a high environmental footprint. In fact, literature estimates that SMEs contribute 60-70% of industrial pollution in Europe (OECD, 2015). SMEs in the manufacturing sector - which accounts for a large share of global resource consumption, pollution, and waste generation – are critical for the 
					green transformation. SMEs also have the potential to engender substantial environmental improvements. (Koirala, 2018).<br>

									<h6 class="card-title"><strong><a href="">COST SAVINGS</a></strong></h4>
									<p>The pledge commitment has listed activities that are not only morally and ethically responsible to engage in; but are money saving with significantly positive environmental impact. We have quantified these sectoral and typical emissions reduction quantity and cost savings. The ability to pursue the most cost-effective carbon mitigation strategies is one of the opportunities that a full knowledge of Carbon Foot printing provides.

									<h6><b>Cost Saving Activities</b></h6>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo10">Switching to an electric fleet of vehicles</a><br>
									<div id="demo10" class="collapse">
										By switching to an electric fleet of vehicles, businesses/organisations could reduce the carbon footprint arising from their transport by two-thirds on average.
                                        There are various forms of grants available in the UK to incentivise the purchase of electric vehicles. Capital allowances can be claimed on low emission cars that reduces the amount of tax businesses are required to pay. On a car costing around £40,000 this could amount to a tax relief of £7,600 in the first year. For company drivers and fleet operators choosing an electric car from April 2020, there will be zero tax on Benefit in Kind (BIK) per year during 2020/2021, and very low BIK from 2021 to 2023 (£55 during 2021/2022 and £110 during 2022/2023) compared to £1400 of a petrol car, using e-Golf and Golf Petrol as an example (EDF Energy, 2019).

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo11">Upgrade Insulation</a><br>
									<div id="demo11" class="collapse">
										According to the report of OVO Energy Ltd and Energy Saving Trust (2020), around 1/3 of the heat loss from most homes is through the walls. Properly insulating cavity walls will save energy and cut costs off the heating ill of companies.
                                        Different types of properties have different emission reductions. A flst can typically save 360kgCO2e per year, while a detached house can save around 1100 kg per year, compared to a gas-heated home. A flat could expect £90 cost savings a year with a payback period of 45 months due to less gas heating consumed, while a detached house could expect £275 a year with a 32-month payback period.

									 </div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo12">Install area occupancy sensors</a><br>
									<div id="demo12" class="collapse">
										Occupancy sensors automatically detect natural light and turn of lighting in unoccupied spaces such as classrooms, conference rooms, public spaces, dormitories and large offices. According to different cases, the emission reduction could range from 6.5 tCO2e year of a company with 1150 staff and 4000 square metre office to 36 tCO2e a year of a company with 500 staff and a three-storey office block.
                                            Scottish Power Ltd. (2020) found that occupancy sensors can cut lighting costs by 50% and are particularly useful in stockrooms and storerooms, toilets, meeting rooms and any areas where lighting is zoned.

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo13">Upgrade to a more efficient boiler</a><br>
									<div id="demo13" class="collapse">
										An efficient boiler has significant influence on heating-related energy savings. A substantial amount of energy can be saved by adopting energy saving measures and by improving the overall boiler efficiency.
                                        The average CO2 emission from a three-bedroom home in GB with a condensing boiler is 5.29 tCO”e per year. This is a 33% reduction in the CO2 emissions of a standard efficiency oil boiler which emits 7.95 tonnes of CO2 p.a (Eurofuel, n.d). The boiler efficiency is much higher in that it requires 25 percent less fuel to create the same amount of heat. For the average 3-bedroom in the UK this means a saving of at least £490 per year with the 33% emission avoided.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo14">Install Solar PV Panels </a><br>
									<div id="demo14" class="collapse">
										Currently, the UK electricity grid emission factor is 0.2556 kg CO2e/kWh (Department for Business Energy & Industrial Strategy, 2017), while the LCA emission of Solar PV is 0.04kg CO2e/kWh (LCA), and emission created in operation and generation phase is only 0.01kg CO2e/kWh (NREL, 2012). Businesses can achieve massive reduction by installing solar PV panels.
                                            With Feed-in Tariff wrap up in 2019, the major way for businesses installing Solar PV to save money is only the reduced electricity purchasing from outside energy suppliers (Lempriere, 2018). A solar PV panel system of 4kWp that costs £6200 can generate 3500kWh electricity per year, which equals to £455 cost savings per year. Businesses could expect around 14 years to reach balance if the electricity tariff stays the same. As solar panels typically run 20 years. Businesses could expect cost savings by installing solar PV systems.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo15">Increase recyclable content of packaging </a><br>
									<div id="demo15" class="collapse">
										The emission reduction of recyclable packaging is certain but varies a lot due to various methods to achieve that. As an example, Dundonald Links Ltd. provided drinking water to staff in plastic bottles. This created a potential litter problem, as well as adding waste quantities and disposal costs. By installing a water cooler, the waste stream was prevented and saved the company £785 per year in the purchase costs of the water alone.
                                        Moreover, the Waste & Resources Action Programme (2020) research shows that consumers display a preference for brands and retailers that use recycled content in their packaging. Recycling plastic content can help to build brand loyalty and change perceptions. An amazing 90% of respondents said that manufacturers and retailers should “just get on with it” and use as much recycled plastic possible.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo16">Installing LED/HVAC lighting </a><br>
									<div id="demo16" class="collapse">
										Energy savings has to do with comparing the old wattage and the new replacement of a supposed LED light. Total energy saving of an LED bulb is 239.4kWh and that of an HVAC bulb is 19.75kWh. Therefore, considering the UK grid emission factor is 0.2556 kgCO2e/kWh, the total emissions avoided by switching to LED lights = Total energy saved x Emissions factor = 239.4kWh x 0.2556 = 61.19 kgCO2e/bulb/yr, and thus emissions avoided by switching to HVAC lighting = 19.75kWh HVAC savings/yr x 0.2556 emissions factor = 5.05 kgCO2e/bulb/year.
                                            Considering the UK electricity tariff is around 13p per kWh, the annual cost savings of a single LED bulb could be £31 and that of a single HVAC bulb could be £2.6. The number seem small but will become significant considering the cumulative effect.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo17">Turning off computers and monitors</a><br>
									<div id="demo17" class="collapse">
										According to Energy saving Trust, a PC monitor that is left on overnight can waste enough electricity to laser print over 500 pages and an energy from devices left on standby accounts for about 5-10% of the total electricity used in residential homes.
                                            We have found out that by turning off your monitor overnight (16hours) and over the weekend (48hours) 151.348kgC02e is saved per year per computer.

									<h6><b>Changes that can Reduce Emission</b></h6>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo3">Reducing waste to landfill</a><br>
									<div id="demo3" class="collapse">
										Recycling also means less waste going to landfill, which means less methane generated. Methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide, 
										is produced when organic materials—such as paper, food and grass—decompose under the anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions present in landfills. In fact,
										landfills are currently the leading source of methane. Recycling food scraps keeps organics out of the landfill and prevents methane generation. 
 
									 </div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo4">switching to a green energy supplier</a><br>
									<div id="demo4" class="collapse">
										In UK grid, the electricity emission factor is 0.2556 kg CO2e/kWh. In Scotland, the factor number should be lower, because 51.7% of electricity 
										is generated from renewables, compared to 25.6% for the rest of UK, but detailed emission factor not published. If purchased from 100% renewable
										supplier, the emission factor is 0 kg CO2e/kWh (theoretical, subject to the number provided by energy supplier). Electricity emission in scope 2 
										reduced to 0, heating & cooling emission unchanged. The percentage of emission reduction (kWh * 0.2556 kg CO2e/kWh) depends on a company’s specific 
										electricity consumption. Meanwhile, by switching to a green supplier, the energy cost will generally remains the same.
										Beyond changes that simply drive down emissions but impact insignificantly on company costs, there are also more changes that businesses can make 
										to reduce emission and save money simultaneously. Furthermore, companies can choose to sign to connected behaviour changes (like Solar PV Panel 
										installation and LED lights replacement) to grab synergy of reducing emissions as well as saving costs.

									<h6 class="card-title"><strong><a href="">Business Networks</a></strong></h4>
									<p>To effectively target the decision makers within smaller organisations, it is our recommendation that Edinburgh Science makes a connection
									with larger organisations that represent them, utilising the various forms of business networks available across Scotland.E.g Chamber of Commerce 
									and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo6">Local Authorities</a><br>
									<div id="demo6" class="collapse">
										In addition to the use of business networks, we would strongly encourage Edinburgh Science to seek the backing of local authorities and use them,
										where possible, to spread information about the business pledge, with The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) suggesting that
										local authorities could have a crucial part to play in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions within the UK. When questioned about the importance 
										of having the backing of the Scottish Government, one participant expresses:
										“I think local authority might be a more powerful level for that. I think that the people I know and the businesses that I work with, see local authorities
										as having a more direct impact on them so therefore they will believe them a bit more”

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo7">Workshops and Forums</a><br>
									<div id="demo7" class="collapse">
										As part of our research, we recommend that signing up to the pledge should provide signatories with sector-focused meetings that will provide pragmatic and 
										tailored trainings, conferences, panel meetings, cross-sector seminars, presentations, high level round table meetings, workshops, to provide meaningful expert advice,
										build awareness, learn transferable skills, network, get updated information and feedbacks, guidance, deliver developments and opportunities for development.
										We were able to research on over 15 different climate related sector-focused meetings that have held in the past (Appendix Y) and have come up with the following
										recommendations for Edinburgh Science:<br>
										a.	Edinburgh Science need to decide their position when being the pledge promoter; as one of the meeting host researched in our list (CILT) set their position as a key
