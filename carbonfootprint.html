					 A key part of the recommended pledge design is mandatory Carbon Footprinting for all businesses who sign up to the pledge. Stressing on the need to explore the awareness among small, medium and large scale units of businesses6, we have recommended that at a minimum, all signatories to the pledge should know their businesses’ carbon footprint, take steps at the next level to reduce emissions and calculate the costs per ton to make those reductions. <br> Increasing the awareness of business to their own climate related activities and allowing them to view their own emissions hotspots is vital in shifting societal attitudes towards a low carbon future.<br>
					 Although there is currently mandatory Carbon Footprinting in the UK for all publicly listed companies on the London Stock Exchange, European Economic State, NYSE or NASDAQ, it’s imperative to push this into the mainstream and start encouraging smaller organisations to play their part as well. <br>
					 This however, needs not be viewed as a ‘cost’ or ‘burden’ to small business owners. By making these businesses aware to the benefits of Carbon Footprinting, as well the various tools and consultancies at their disposal to undergo this, the proposal suddenly becomes a much less daunting one. <br>
					 A Carbon Footprint can be defined as a measure of:
					“The total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly and indirectly by a person, organisation, event or product” (Carbon Trust, 2018).

									<h6 class="card-title"><strong><a href="">Reasons For Carbon Footprinting </a></strong></h4>
									<p>Calculating Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions within an organisation’s boundary allows business owners to identify their key emissions sources and highlight key opportunities for mitigation practices to reduce these ‘hotspots’.<br>
									It then opens the door for businesses to create new risk management practices, green strategies and report their progress publicly, or internally, if they wish to do so (Carbon Trust, 2018). <br>
									As well as being key to encouraging greater mindfulness and getting companies to drive down their emissions, it is extremely important to relay to the business owners the various short-term and long-term benefits they can experience through undertaking their own Carbon Footprints.

									<h6><b>Reasons/Benefits for Carbon Measurement</b></h6>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo11">Cost Reduction</a><br>
									<div id="demo11" class="collapse">
										The ability to pursue the most cost-effective carbon mitigation strategies is one of the opportunities that a full knowledge of  Carbon 
										Footprinting provides (Perillon, 2019). Following the rule that only what is measurable is manageable, Carbon Footprint calculations is an emerging 
										important tool for greenhouse gas management which has been commercialised in different areas of the economy and life^3 and more importantly, 
										most businesses have found that developing product GHG inventories delivers a positive return on investment9. <br>
										However, a greater range of cost saving opportunities will be discussed in greater further along in the report. 

									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo12">Consistency with Trending Expectation </a><br>
									<div id="demo12" class="collapse">
										With the changing shift in attitudes towards a more climate conscious society, it is an opportunity to demonstrate how a business is actively on 
										the pathway to transition to sustainability & low-carbon with the growing consumer sentiments that are rising out of need for low-carbon products 
										and develop resilience for regulatory reforms.
									</div>
									 
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo13">Regulatory Compliance</a><br>
									<div id="demo13" class="collapse">
										As the UK strives to achieve net-zero over the coming decades, a plethora of tighter environmental regulations will be introduced that will impact
										business owners across the nation. A notable recent example is the 2035 ban on diesel and petrol cars introduced by the UK government, which could 
										have detrimental effects to those businesses who have yet to make the switch to electric or hybrid vehicles. Additionally, for those small businesses 
										who see themselves growing into larger organisations, companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, European Economic State, NYSE or NASDAQ are mandated
										to report their emissions (Carbon Footprinting). Undertaking Carbon Foot printing now allows these businesses to get ahead of the curve and start planning 
										(Perillon, 2019).
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo14">Helps with Disclosure to Investors</a><br>
									<div id="demo14" class="collapse">
										In line with the strategy to effectively manage carbon, Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) helps to model the environment’s impact on a business.<br>
										Therefore, we hope that these SMEs will transition to large companies in the nearest future and would need to understand what financial markets want from disclosure in order 
										to measure and respond to climate change risks, and encourage them to align their disclosures with investors needs. Therefore, we believe that part of the educational 
										opportunity and benefit of being a pledge signatory will be informed education on TCFDs.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo15">Risk Management Strategies are built.</a><br>
									<div id="demo15" class="collapse">
										Risk management is vital for a business regardless of its size. By these Scottish SMEs measuring their own Carbon Footprint, they will have in depth knowledge to potential supply
										chain risks and direct regulatory risks arising from certain areas of their operation. It forces the businesses to formulate strategies to managing any climate related risk exposure 
										because of the discipline of sorting out which activities are material/important to report on and in what depth.

									<p>Based on the size of our target audience (Small and Medium Businesses), scope 1&2 are the required boundaries for measurement due to the complexity

									within the GHG protocol, there are steps that these businesses must take before measuring and reporting their greenhouse gas impacts; they are:

									<h6><b>Steps/Protocols for Measuring Carbon Footprint</b></h6><br>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo21">1.	Set Organisational Boundary </a><br>
									<div id="demo21" class="collapse">
										If it is a simple structure in which you own 100% of the assets, then it is important that you report from all the impacts from all that is owned
										and operated and if it is complex, there are guidelines to follow which involves your financial and operational control boundary, equity share boundary 
										and the reporting framework to follow to avoid double counting. 

									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo22">2.	Set Operational Boundary  </a><br>
									<div id="demo22" class="collapse">
										This is effectively where the reporting business splits its emission sources into three categories: Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. The breakdown of 
										these scopes is shown in the figure X, as well as defined in the GHG Protocol as the following: <br>
										Scope 1: “A reporting organisations direct GHG emissions”.<br>
										Scope 2: “A reporting organisations emissions associated with the generation of electricity, heating/cooling, or steam purchase for own consumption”.<br>
										Scope 3: “A reporting organisations indirect emissions other than those covered in Scope.<br>

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo23">3. Determine Data collection period .</a><br>
									<div id="demo23" class="collapse">
										Determine the data collection period. This ideally is supposed to correspond to your financial year to allow for the comparison to your financial performance and 
										other business aspects.
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo24">4. Collect Activity Data of you Operation</a><br>
									<div id="demo24" class="collapse">
										It is essential that in collecting their activity data, these businesses understand the key environmental issues and their impacts through their operations (business travels,
										energy source, etc.). They are likely to fall under six categories, which are Greenhouse gases, Water, Waste, Materials and resource efficiency, Biodiversity, Emissions to air, land and water. 
									</div>
									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo25">5.	Apply Emissions Factors and Convert </a><br>
									<div id="demo25" class="collapse">
										Each Greenhouse Gas has a different relative heating factor compared to CO_2. All measurements are then converted into a single unit called Carbon Dioxide equivalent 〖(CO〗_2 e). This actual 
										calculation will be using a standard and the most suitable means for SMEs (standard spreadsheets developed by Econometrica consulting company).

									<a href="" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo26">6.	Report you findings </a><br>
									<div id="demo26" class="collapse">
