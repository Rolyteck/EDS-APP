					<p style = "font-size:17px">
					    Carbon offset schemes were set up to allow the largest polluters who exceed permitted emissions’ levels to fund projects, such as reforestation, that reduce carbon dioxide in the air, essentially balancing out their emissions equation. The types of carbon offset projects that are implemented are diverse. They range from forestry sequestration projects (which remove CO2 from the atmosphere when trees grow) to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects (which reduce
                            future CO2 emissions in the atmosphere).<br>
                            Businesses can achieve carbon neutral or even carbon net negative as long as they are willing to pay the price. A relatively small offsetting market has recently seen a fresh boom, that since autumn in 2019 a lot of new demand has occurred, and the current remaining credits will not be able to meet that demand very soon. Hundreds of companies are offering such schemes around the world. <br>
                            In Scotland, there are 20000 hectares of peatland restoration and 12000 hectares of woodland created every year (The Scottish Government, 2018). This shows massive potential of carbon
                            offsetting, yet only a fraction developed as carbon offsetting programmes. According to our calculation, the total carbon offsetting capacity in Scotland should be more than 7 million tonnes of CO2e per year (Forestry and Land Scotland, 2020b).<br>
                            In terms of accreditation, verification, locality and lagged effects due to time consumed for trees to grow or peatland to be restored, we managed to identify 3 programmes for businesses to participate.<br>

                            (b) Trees 4 Life<br>
                            (c) Forestry and Land Scotland
                            
                            
						<!--The pledge commitment has listed activities that are not only morally and ethically responsible to
						engage in; but are money saving with significantly positive environmental impact.
						We have quantified these sectoral and typical emissions reduction quantity and cost savings. The
						ability to pursue the most cost-effective carbon mitigation strategies is one of the opportunities that
						a full knowledge of Carbon Foot printing provides.<br><br>
						<b>Switching to an electric fleet of vehicles</b><br>
						By switching to an electric fleet of vehicles, businesses/organisations could reduce the carbon
						footprint arising from their transport by two-thirds on average.<br>
						There are various forms of grants available in the UK to incentivise the purchase of electric vehicles.
						Capital allowances can be claimed on low emission cars that reduces the amount of tax businesses
						are required to pay. On a car costing around £40,000 this could amount to a tax relief of £7,600 in
						the first year. For company drivers and fleet operators choosing an electric car from April 2020,
						there will be zero tax on Benefit in Kind (BIK) per year during 2020/2021, and very low BIK from 2021
						to 2023 (£55 during 2021/2022 and £110 during 2022/2023) compared to £1400 of a petrol car,
						using e-Golf and Golf Petrol as an example (EDF Energy, 2019).<br>
						<b>Upgrade Insulation</b><br>
						According to the report of OVO Energy Ltd and Energy Saving Trust (2020), around 1/3 of the heat
						loss from most homes is through the walls. Properly insulating cavity walls will save energy and cut
						costs off the heating ill of companies.<br>
						Different types of properties have different emission reductions. A flst can typically save 360kgCO2e
						per year, while a detached house can save around 1100 kg per year, compared to a gas-heated
						home. A flat could expect £90 cost savings a year with a payback period of 45 months due to less gas
						heating consumed, while a detached house could expect £275 a year with a 32-month payback
						period.<br>
						<b>Install area occupancy sensors</b><br>
						Occupancy sensors automatically detect natural light and turn of lighting in unoccupied spaces such
						as classrooms, conference rooms, public spaces, dormitories and large offices. According to different
						cases, the emission reduction could range from 6.5 tCO2e year of a company with 1150 staff and
						4000 square metre office to 36 tCO2e a year of a company with 500 staff and a three-storey office
						block.<br>
						Scottish Power Ltd. (2020) found that occupancy sensors can cut lighting costs by 50% and are
						particularly useful in stockrooms and storerooms, toilets, meeting rooms and any areas where
						lighting is zoned.<br>
						<b>Upgrade to a more efficient boiler</b><br>
						An efficient boiler has significant influence on heating-related energy savings. A substantial amount
						of energy can be saved by adopting energy saving measures and by improving the overall boiler
						efficiency.<br>
						The average CO2 emission from a three-bedroom home in GB with a condensing boiler is 5.29 tCO”e
						per year. This is a 33% reduction in the CO2 emissions of a standard efficiency oil boiler which emits

						7.95 tonnes of CO2 p.a (Eurofuel, n.d). The boiler efficiency is much higher in that it requires 25
						percent less fuel to create the same amount of heat. For the average 3-bedroom in the UK this
						means a saving of at least £490 per year with the 33% emission avoided.<br>
						<b>Install Solar PV Panels</b><br>
						Currently, the UK electricity grid emission factor is 0.2556 kg CO2e/kWh (Department for Business
						Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy, 2017), while the LCA emission of Solar PV is 0.04kg CO2e/kWh (LCA),
						and emission created in operation and generation phase is only 0.01kg CO2e/kWh (NREL, 2012).
						Businesses can achieve massive reduction by installing solar PV panels.<br>
						With Feed-in Tariff wrap up in 2019, the major way for businesses installing Solar PV to save money
						is only the reduced electricity purchasing from outside energy suppliers (Lempriere, 2018). A solar
						PV panel system of 4kWp that costs £6200 can generate 3500kWh electricity per year, which equals
						to £455 cost savings per year. Businesses could expect around 14 years to reach balance if the
						electricity tariff stays the same. As solar panels typically run 20 years. Businesses could expect cost
						savings by installing solar PV systems.<br>
						<b>Increase recyclable content of packaging</b><br>
						The emission reduction of recyclable packaging is certain but varies a lot due to various methods to
						achieve that. As an example, Dundonald Links Ltd. provided drinking water to staff in plastic bottles.
						This created a potential litter problem, as well as adding waste quantities and disposal costs. By
						installing a water cooler, the waste stream was prevented and saved the company £785 per year in
						the purchase costs of the water alone.<br>
						Moreover, the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (2020) research shows that consumers display
						a preference for brands and retailers that use recycled content in their packaging. Recycling plastic
						content can help to build brand loyalty and change perceptions. An amazing 90% of respondents
						said that manufacturers and retailers should “just get on with it” and use as much recycled plastic
						possible.<br>
						<b>Installing LED/HVAC lighting</b><br>
						Energy savings has to do with comparing the old wattage and the new replacement of a supposed
						LED light. Total energy saving of an LED bulb is 239.4kWh and that of an HVAC bulb is 19.75kWh.
						Therefore, considering the UK grid emission factor is 0.2556 kgCO2e/kWh, the total emissions
						avoided by switching to LED lights = Total energy saved x Emissions factor = 239.4kWh x 0.2556 =
						61.19 kgCO2e/bulb/yr, and thus emissions avoided by switching to HVAC lighting = 19.75kWh HVAC
						savings/yr x 0.2556 emissions factor = 5.05 kgCO2e/bulb/year.<br>
						Considering the UK electricity tariff is around 13p per kWh, the annual cost savings of a single LED
						bulb could be £31 and that of a single HVAC bulb could be £2.6. The number seem small but will
						become significant considering the cumulative effect.<br>
						<b>Turning off computers and monitors</b><br>
						According to Energy saving Trust, a PC monitor that is left on overnight can waste enough electricity
						to laser print over 500 pages and an energy from devices left on standby accounts for about 5-10%
						of the total electricity used in residential homes.<br>
						We have found out that by turning off your monitor overnight (16hours) and over the weekend
						(48hours) 151.348kgC02e is saved per year per computer.-->
